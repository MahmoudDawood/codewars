A repository filled with codewars challenges where I push 7 solutions per week.. Will be updated once I reach 2 kyu.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

Can't solve a problem? we'll get alot of those, the only thing to worry about is trying the best we could and trust the process.
....can't solve it yet.. Let's try another one and rethink about it tomorrow.
