A repository filled with codewars challenges where I push 7 solutions per week.. Will be updated once I reach 2 kyu.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned:

Can't solve a problem? we'll get alot of those, the only thing to worry about is trying the best we could and trust the process.
....can't solve it yet.. just give and quit maaan!
